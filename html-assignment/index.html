        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hello, I'm Morgan, I am 20 years old (born January 24<sup>th</sup>, 2002). My family is from Newfoundland. However, I was raised in Ottawa. I went to <abbr title="Sacred Heart High School">SHHS</abbr> and graduated in 2020. I took a year off to work at Pet Valu. Working there helped me gain confidence and bring my true personality out.</p>
        <p>My greatest passion is animals. In the past year, I've become very fond of reptiles. I own three geckos, all different species. Though my <em>favourite</em> animal will always be dogs. I've loved them since I was born. I've researched them for my entire life and have learned to understand them. I hope to someday have a second job working with dogs.</p>
